Prologue

The ocean didn't remember any hard feelings. Like the sky, he believed in freedom, like
the sky, he did not tolerate obstacles. I stood on the wet sand, the waves licking my feet,
and it was so easy to believe that the strange star in the sky was my Sun, and
the salt water was the ancient cradle of humanity.But the coastline is too flat. Straight as the horizon, and
just as fake. If you go along the coast, nothing will change:
on the right hand will stretch low, as if trimmed, groves, on
the left-the surf will hiss. Only the sand under your feet will change color,
from yellow to white, from white to pink, from pink to black, and
back again. The strip of beach will turn imperceptibly to the right,
snow will cover it, then sand will stretch again, and someday, very
soon, I will return to the same point where the waves will still caress
the shore…One person is already too many to change the world. I took
a step, and the water filled my tracks with a hiss. The world is already too
small to be left alone. Yes and no serenity for the living.
Only the sea and sky know peace.I raised my right hand, looked at it – and the fingers began
to lengthen. I sculpted them with my eyes, turning human flesh into
sharp, curved claws.However, do I still have the right to call myself a human being?
